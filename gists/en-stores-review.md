## üá®üá± Chilean Stores

üá®üá± *Unless you know the typical price range for a product, relying only on the first search results can lead to outlandish costs. Check multiple pages that list the product (In Stock), and consider the condition: is it new, used, or refurbished?*  
üá®üá± *Depending on your hobby, there may be dedicated pages. For LEGO, check [BrickEconomy](https://www.brickeconomy.com/) and [BrickLink](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/main.page) ‚Äî prices tend to be higher on one and lower on the other, depending on conditions. For anime items, try [Buy Finder](https://buyfinder.moe/). You get the idea!*

| ----------------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Richirocko              | Figures       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê   | Good overall experience. I started with this store but later switched to international ones for more variety. They usually ship at the end of the week, which adds some extra time. Also available on Mercado Libre.            |
| Newtype Chile           | Figures       | ‚≠ê       | Avoid at all costs. Preorders are unreliable. I only managed to get a refund by going directly to the physical store.                                                                                                          |
| Tio Kubito              | Resin Figures | ‚≠ê       | Avoid unless the item is in stock. Same issues as Newtype.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Galaxia Anime           | Figures       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Highly recommended! I was able to find rare figmas locally.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Coleccionables BiÃÅo-BiÃÅo  | Figures       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Bought a few times directly and through Mercado Libre ‚Äî everything arrived as expected.                                                                                                                                        |
| Taka No Dan            | Mixed       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê    | A lot of card games, figures and Doujinshis. Good attention.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Mercado Libre           | Anything      | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê   | Great for used products. Adding *"used"* to searches helps find items more easily and sometimes at good prices.                                                                                                                |
| Marketplace             | Anything      | ‚≠ê‚≠ê     | Can be good for small or cheap items, but requires social media.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Other stores            | Figures       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê     | Varies a lot ‚Äî take recommendations with a grain of salt.                                                                                                                                                                      |

## üåç International Stores

üì¶ *Anything shipped with DHL usually arrives in Chile within 3‚Äì4 days once the package is processed.*  
üì¶ *When the carrier is unclear, the charges you pay at customs will usually depend on the shipment details.*  
üì¶ *At least for Chile, my worst experience with a carrier was with FedEx. If any information is missing, they won‚Äôt be eager to contact you, and any day the package stays in storage will be charged ‚Äî which can get expensive.*  
üì¶ *A common requirement for purchases (especially from Japan) is your TAX ID, so missing this information can cause delays.*

| Store                 | Type    | Rating | Shipment Details           | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ebay                  | Mixed   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê   | Depends on seller | Depends heavily on the seller. Taxes can make some items expensive, so buying a lot (figures, LEGO, etc.) may make more sense. Most of the time, though, everything is overpriced. With shipment costs, consider dedicated stores instead. Additional charges may depend a lot on the carrier than the declared value.                                                                                                     |
| Amazon                | Mixed   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê   | Normal            | I mostly use it for Steamforged games and other specific items. Everything else tends to be overpriced ‚Äî Amazon JP is usually better. Orders fulfilled directly by Amazon are shipped with DHL (at least to Chile).                                                                                                                           |
| Amazon JP             | Figures | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Normal/Depends on Seller            | Excellent for Japan exclusives. No proxy needed, and you can order a wide variety of products. Orders shipped by Amazon use DHL (to Chile). Other shipment options are relative safe, and may not punish you that much with taxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Bricklink             | LEGO | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Relaxed           | Took me a while to buy here. You can filter results for stores that ship to your country. Some display shipping costs right away, while others only provide them after you submit the purchase. Payment is through PayPal. Usually cheaper than Amazon JP if you do the math. I use Bricklink to estimate a fair local price (+30% margin for safety). |
| Fanatical Anime Store | Figures | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Normal            | Reliable for resin and preorders. Ships with DHL and offers good support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Nin-Nin Game          | Figures | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Relaxed            | Wide variety, prices usually fair (though sometimes inflated). Features restock alerts and ‚Äúpay later‚Äù options on some preorders. Be aware: if one item in your order is delayed, the whole shipment waits. Support can cancel items, but I usually prefer waiting.                                        |
| Solaris Japan         | Figures | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Custom           | Good variety with some shipping support. Sometimes products disappear and reappear a few weeks later ‚Äî more FOMO than actual restocking.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| BCDolls               | Dolls   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Normal            | At first I wasn‚Äôt sure about buying directly, but the price difference compared to resellers was too much to ignore. Thankfully, support answered all my questions and the purchase went smoothly. Totally recommended.                                                                                                                         |
| Hobby Link Japan      | Mixed   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê     | Normal           | Not really my favorite, I prefer Nin-Nin. Still, they carry some hard-to-find products. Just note: items are listed in detail on the package (if you catch my drift).                                                                                                                                 |

## üá®üá≥ AliExpress Stores

üí° *AliExpress sells legit products too, not only knockoffs. Some stores use dropshipping, so shipping may be delayed by about a week.*  
üí° *Always check product details. If the listing doesn‚Äôt mention the brand or parent company (e.g., Good Smile, Max Factory), it‚Äôs likely a bootleg.*  
üí° *Typical ‚Äúgood‚Äù prices are close to retail with a small discount (e.g., $230 ‚Üí $200 with shipping). During sales you can add coupons for a better deal, but if you see something at 50% off, double-check carefully ‚Äî it‚Äôs almost always a fake.*

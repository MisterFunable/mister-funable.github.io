# The Reality of One-to-One Scale Dolls: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

There are two universal truths that enthusiasts eventually discover when researching premium collectible dolls. First, those "hot singles in your area" ads are never genuine. Second, authentic one-to-one scale dolls from reputable manufacturers start at approximately $1,800 USD and can exceed $3,000. And if you get truly premium, look for a $6,000+ USD

While some websites advertise complete customization packages for under $800, these typically result in receiving counterfeit products that fail to meet quality standards. As someone reserching this, reality can be disappointing. This guide addresses common questions and provides essential information for informed decision-making.

### What is One-to-One Scale?

One-to-one scale refers to dolls that are proportioned to represent realistic human dimensions, typically ranging from 1.6 to 1.8 meters in height. These dolls are designed with anatomical accuracy and premium materials, making them significantly more expensive than smaller scale alternatives.

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Are AliExpress dolls authentic? What about dolls priced under $800?**
A: Generally, no. Unless you're purchasing individual components (such as a torso without limbs and head), these are typically counterfeit products. However, individual components don't constitute a complete doll.

**Q: What about local brands with questionable sized dolls?**
A: This would require individual investigation and verification. Always research thoroughly before purchasing from lesser-known manufacturers.

**Q: Are there community resources available?**
A: Yes, several Reddit communities provide valuable information, reviews, and discussions about various brands and models.

- **Game Lady Doll** - Known for character-based designs

For serious collectors and enthusiasts, the premium price tag reflects the craftsmanship, materials, and support that reputable manufacturers provide. Always research thoroughly, purchase from authorized sources, and consider the total cost of ownership including maintenance and accessories.

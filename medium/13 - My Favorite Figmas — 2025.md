# My Favorite Figmas - 2025

With over 160+ Figmas, of course I have some favorites. I meant to do a video about this, but if I don't... at least I have this post!

You can tell a lot about me based on my taste in anime/waifus. So beforehand, sorry for oversharing! Let's goooooooo

> I would expect a reaction like: "Nyaruko? understandable. Dark Magician? A classic. Aqua??? Why???"

- [Aqua](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/675314): The colors, the character, and the facial expressions!

- [Dark Magician Girl](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/236205): (G)old.

- [Nyaruko](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/106984): I'm kinda into lovecraftian waifus, plus she's a deredere, and those heels? 10/10.

- [Labrys](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/117923): Everyone loves toasters with a detachable axe that looks like butterfly wings. Also armor and rocket punches.

- [Ryuko](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/198008): For the plot/personality of course. Here's the [47 min video](https://youtu.be/IdeJ1FKdiQE?si=uaxN-MM8UOOGh1Wm) explaining that.

- [Black Rock Shooter](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/75621): I've always liked the character design, and the bikini above all else. I don't have more from this franchise (besides White) because it's pretty expensive.

> Cute is justice

- [Gwendolyn](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/553119#): Reminds me of Melia (XC1). I haven't played the game, but bird girl 👏 

- [Hachikuji](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/61332): It's not what it looks like. The design is cute, plus did you see those shoe soles?

- [Cute](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/10216): It's what it looks like... cute design, same character designer as Monogatari and Popotan (if you are that old).

> This could be either place 10 or 1 depending on the mood.

- [Emilia](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/729346): I was here before season 3 defending the greatness of Emilia. Also, my first Figma.

- [Drossel (Charming)](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/61376): amazing figure, one of my favorites if not THE favorite.

> Do I like Madoka Magica because of the figures or do I like the figures because of Madoka Magica?

- [Shinobu](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/341015) (FigFix): A collab with Madoka Magica. Since it's a FigFix, no articulation visible.

- [Ultimate Madoka](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/117907): Not a spoiler after 10+ years. Wonderful dress, horrible to pose. Overall great. Good moment to mention the [movie parody](https://youtu.be/B5cnT0r3Fa0?si=9u5rsGp74Q8XbuFX&t=850) with enough Star Wars references.

- [Dusty](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/346557): Love the design and the poses you can make with her. I got recently [Coucy](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/462172) and I thought I would like it more, but no.

> Soulless machines... at least one of them.

- [Metis](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/42067): It may be a relative simple design, but I love the mask (like the frame on the [FES OP](https://youtu.be/lGjPut-k-7U?si=nAv6uUGaF7JdwOVm&t=42)) and that's enough for me.

- [Misaka Imouto](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/48795): I like [Misaka Mikoto](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/37863) more, but this clone of her comes with a big sniper rifle and machine gun.

- [Aigis](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/122075): KIMI WA NE TOSHIKA NI ANO TOKI (but with [Labrys](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/117923) colors).

And that's it! I will probably make one for B-Style but until then,

Peace!

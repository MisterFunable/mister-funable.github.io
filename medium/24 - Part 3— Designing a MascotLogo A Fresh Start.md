# Part 3— Designing a Mascot/Logo: A Fresh Start

Part 2 will be delayed because I had to make this, and it's way faster to do it right away.

In this post I go through the "creative process" which is prompting until I realize what I want and then try to do it, while keeping my sanity points at a decent threshold (as always).

As with previous AI posts, I'll include some of the prompts used in quotes.

> **TL;DR**: I realized that I just wanted the balloon while keeping the suit. And that I had to question what I really wanted instead of prompting until I hit gold. Feasible if you don't pay for credits and use the free tier for Nanobana Pro. Otherwise, think a little, make some sketches or something.

> The result was a logo recognizable to old subs but simplified and more catchy.

When I finally came to terms with the YouTube account deletion, after reuploading and holding off on things for a while, I needed to do something for my "main" logo. It was a little awkward to have it there, looking at me in disappointment. "How did they get you?" You know, the equivalent of a woman cutting her hair to represent transformation.

I had a random logo that I generated for Medium amidst all of this: a smiley balloon with a red cross on the face. It was for the "cancellable" aspect of it rather than "no happiness," though at this point I don't think it's that different.

Since that version of me is dead, it was odd doing more things with the old logo. I wanted something different.

I wanted to keep the new logo, so I tried a few things.

## About the New YouTube Channel Logos

<!-- Image Source: https://miro.medium.com/1*hk_hXXXCw3k-VPdVyLmPnQ.png | Local: images/24/img-05.png -->

This will be for another post, but I divided the content from the original channel into five channels at the moment of writing this.

That will be its own post. The takeaway from this is that I finally used the mascot character (Chibi Ver.) for the YouTube logos, multiple colors and ordered as Power Rangers.

## First Interation: Shooting in the Dark

Since my YouTube accounts had different colors, I wanted black for the main one even if it's just an "index" for the rest of the channels. But I wanted to keep the current Medium logo.

<!-- Image Source: https://miro.medium.com/1*IRjikmOalCse-BDUZAz9ug.png | Local: images/24/img-06.png -->

![](images/24/img-07.jpg)

> **Prompt**: I want a perfect square but circle inside with abstract art representation of the character focused on colors.

Even tried the male version for the funzies. Not sharing because it's mid.

In my mind I wanted something akin to shapes, simplified, that also had the X. So I wasn't sure how or where to go.

![**Prompt Summary**: I don't know what I want, give me something more simple, now more defined shapes without giving it away, now focused on the character.](images/24/img-10.jpg)

Don't know how it went to Gryffindor but well. Back to the balloon I guess.

## Second Iteration: Trying to Enhance the Current Logo

> **Prompt**: Make it better to be in a square image and being mostly used in circles for profile picture.

<!-- Image Source: https://miro.medium.com/1*QOQk8URWyW0m7H9FI8jskQ.jpeg | Local: images/24/img-11.jpg -->

<!-- Image Source: https://miro.medium.com/1*NCCtdVI-3dr-j3Oltwo8XQ.jpeg | Local: images/24/img-12.jpg -->
![](images/24/img-12.jpg)

That didn't work as expected, so I passed the base logo and requested to have it more like that, bright colors, and an X for the balloon.

<!-- Image Source: https://miro.medium.com/1*0r4DKZx7bP16F3y9wDmevw.png | Local: images/24/img-02.png -->

![Bright colors, and a cross for the ballon](images/24/img-14.jpg)

> **Prompt**: maybe try a more catchy good combination of colors but I like where it's going, also, maybe make the X follow the contour of the balloon.

![**Note to self**: it can get cursed with the monkey paw AI.](images/24/img-17.jpg)

Yes, the prompt "make the cross part of the balloon" backfired horribly.

## Fourth Iteration: Balloon

> **Prompt**: Replace the head with a balloon with an X on the head and a happy expression.

<!-- Image Source: https://miro.medium.com/1*0r4DKZx7bP16F3y9wDmevw.png | Local: images/24/img-02.png -->

![](images/24/img-18.jpg)

So an X looks fine as eyes, so two may work, then let's try it.

> **Prompt**: make two X to be the eyes.

> **Prompt**: keep the suit red

> **Prompt**: improve the quality, remove noise and move the mouth to the correct position

I tried other iterations since I was happy but not conformed with the results...

![Something seemed off...](images/24/img-23.jpg)

Zoomed out and realized that it's a great logo if you aim for serial killer. After a while it reminded me of the Red John smiley face.

## Fifth Iteration: Less Creepy

> **Prompt**: can you make the X white and change the balloon color to an orange like the tie, and change the tie color to one that makes sense.

<!-- Image Source: https://miro.medium.com/1*i3cIU6r9_sz4wy5kiG2fPA.jpeg | Local: images/24/img-27.jpg -->

![Finally, this makes more sense.](images/24/img-28.png)

The blue makes sense, represents Chilean flag colors, so great job AI, and bad me because I didn't notice nor care until I saw it there.

> **Prompt**: Please increase the size of the balloon person within the circle so it appears on top of the border.

## Part 6: Vento Aureo

This had more to do with the borders. Since my last prompt asked to move the head more to the top, the upper border will be small, which I'm fine with.

<!-- Image Source: https://miro.medium.com/1*JH9UaFDijIlxfUui4xNB7g.png | Local: images/24/img-32.png -->
![](images/24/img-32.png)

<!-- Image Source: https://miro.medium.com/1*__W6yB4LYtThhO-TtMwoEQ.jpeg | Local: images/24/img-33.jpg -->
![It doesn't bother me, It bothers me, it bothers me a lot.](images/24/img-33.jpg)

The issue with the border colors was noticeable if you added it to pages that didn't allow you to adjust the position of the image. For those cases, you would see white/empty space.

So to avoid that stupid problem, I:

1. Locally removed the background with the Image Preview from macOS.

2. Upscaled it with [Upscale Media](https://www.upscale.media/es).

3. Shared it to my phone.

4. Opened Lightroom, adjusted colors, removed the thingy from the circle.

5. Shared it back to my computer.

6. Edited it on Canva to add the background.

And finally it was ready to share on social media. And since it was Friday, with this, it's more than enough.

## Results

Quite happy with the result. I'm really not there, since my sub accounts have the content, but the old me is there. It kinda works both in a spiritual and organizational way.

I believe that, and that makes me happy.

## What's Next

If there's something to take from this, it's that prompting until you hit gold is inefficient. Stopping to ask yourself "what do I actually want?" saves time. And if you're not on a free tier burning through credits, maybe sketch something first.

That said, editing skills and knowing the right tools go a long way. The AI got me 80% there, but Canva, Lightroom, and macOS Image Preview handled the rest.

You don't need to be a designer, but knowing how to remove a background or adjust colors makes a difference.

Next post (maybe not from this series) will be about organization. Keeping your online presence consistent requires planning, and things scale fast. Especially when you're juggling multiple accounts and activities. But that will be for another time.

## Bonus

It's been a while since I tried to generate something from a quick draft. Let's see how it goes.

Still too troublesome to make something consistent or exactly as I want without more than 20 minutes of effort.

![](images/24/img-39.jpg)

I'll try to figure out how to course correct the problem where, after many prompts, it starts saturating the images with lines and weird colors. Like, her face looks more yellow.

Well, that's for another time.
